0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

Sure, I'll describe each search algorithm without including specific code implementations.

1. **Linear Search (Sequential Search)**:
   - **Description**: Linear search is the simplest search algorithm where each element of the list is checked sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.
   - **Implementation**: In C, you would typically use a loop to iterate through the array or list, comparing each element with the target value. If a match is found, you return the index; otherwise, if you reach the end of the list without finding the element, you return a specified "not found" indicator like `-1`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - **Description**: Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements based on the comparison.
   - **Implementation**: In C, binary search is often implemented iteratively using a `while` loop. You calculate the middle index of the current search range and adjust the boundaries (`low` and `high`) accordingly based on whether the middle element is less than or greater than the target value.

3. **Interpolation Search**:
   - **Description**: Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search, particularly effective when the elements are uniformly distributed. Instead of always dividing the search space in half, it uses interpolation to estimate the position of the target element.
   - **Implementation**: In C, interpolation search involves calculating an approximate position (`pos`) within the search range using a formula based on the values of the elements. This position is then used to adjust the search boundaries (`low` and `high`) similar to binary search.

4. **Hash Table (Hash Map)**:
   - **Description**: Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to buckets or slots within an array. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.
   - **Implementation**: In C, hash tables are typically implemented using arrays (to hold buckets) and linked lists (to handle collisions). You need to define or use a hash function to determine the index where each key-value pair should be stored and retrieved.

These descriptions provide an overview of each search algorithm's concept and typical implementation strategies in C. When using these algorithms in practice, you'll need to write specific C code tailored to your data structures and requirements. Each algorithm has its trade-offs in terms of time complexity, memory usage, and suitability for different types of data.
